# FaceDetector
This is a small project about face detection , age and gender estimation using pre-trained models.

-we could choose the detect source videos/images/camera from the menu
-we could choose the face detection model haarcascade or a TensorFlow net from the menu.
-we could choose the age and gender estimation caffemodel net or SSR-Net from the menu.
-The project will show the process time of one image.

It is a Excellent project. The author has studied a lot about existing Open-Source Projects for Gender and Age Estimation.Thanks very much for sharing!

Based on the [ diovisgood/agender ](https://github.com/diovisgood/agender), The FaceDetector change the functions structure of main.py and Add menu to choose the detect source, the  model to detect faces, and the model of age and gender estimation.
