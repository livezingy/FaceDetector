It is a Excellent project. The author has studied a lot about existing Open-Source Projects for Gender and Age Estimation.Thanks very much for sharing!
Based on the [ diovisgood/agender ](https://github.com/diovisgood/agender), The FaceDetector change the functions structure of main.py and Add menu to choose the model to detect faces, and choose the model of age and gender estimation.
